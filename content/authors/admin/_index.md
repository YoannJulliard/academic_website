<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
I am a PhD student in social psychology in the LIP/PC2S lab at Univ. Grenoble Alpes. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
My research interests include 'implicit' processes and more specifically approach/avoidance tendencies, grounded cognition, methods in psychological science, and data analytic methods. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
I currently work under the supervision of Dominique Muller on the memory processes underlying approach/avoidance tendencies. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
Beside my academic activities, I spend a bunch of time trying to understand the climate change issue and related topics such as energy supply.
