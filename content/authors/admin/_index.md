<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
I am a PhD student in social cognition in the LIP/PC2S lab at Univ. Grenoble Alpes. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
My research interests include controversially-called 'implicit processes' (and more specifically approach/avoidance tendencies), non-abstractive memory models, methods in psychological science (e.g., open science stuff), and data analytic methods (i.e., things using R). 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
I currently work under the supervision of Dominique Muller on the memory processes underlying approach/avoidance tendencies. 
</p>

Beside my academic activities, I spend a bunch of time trying to understand the climate change issue and related topics such as energy supply. I occasionally organize conferences about climate change and energy.
