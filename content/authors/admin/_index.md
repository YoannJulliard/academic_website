<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
I am an independent researcher in social psychology, associated to LIP/PC2S laboratory (Univ. Grenoble Alpes)
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
My research interests include 'implicit' social cognition and more specifically approach/avoidance tendencies, grounded cognition, methods in psychological science, and data analysis. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
I mainly work on the memory processes underlying approach/avoidance tendencies. I also have some research activities on carbon footprint metacognition. Currently, I am training in Data Science.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align: justify;'> 
Beside my professional activities, I am concerned about climate change and related topics such as energy supply or biodiversity.
