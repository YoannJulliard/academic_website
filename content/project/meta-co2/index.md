title: META-CO2
summary: To reduce our carbon footprint we should know to what extent our behaviors emit CO2. Better, we should know whether our knowledge on CO2 emissions is reliable. This project aims at evaluating people's metacognition on CO2 emissions.

CO2 emissions cause climate change. In the Paris agreement, we engaged in limiting global warming below 2°C (and ideally below 1.5°C). To respect this agreement, CO2 emissions will have to shrink. However, to have an impact on our CO2 emissions we need to know to what extent our daily behaviors contribute to emit CO2.

Better, we need to know whether our knowledge on CO2 emissions are reliable. Indeed, it would be deleterious that one thinks knowing how much CO2 some behavior emits but being deeply wrong on it. It would be better that one knows that he or she do not know what CO2 emissions are associated to this behavior.

The META-CO2 project aims at evaluating both people knowledge and metacognition on CO2 emissions associated to various behaviors. The main goal of the project is to develop a task that evaluate people's CO2 metacognition. Furthermore, the project also aims at giving personalized feedback to people about their own CO2 metacognition (see my <a href="https://yoannjulliard.netlify.app/post/meta-co2" target="_blank" title="yoannjulliard.netlify.app/post/meta-co2">post on META-CO2</a> to know more).
